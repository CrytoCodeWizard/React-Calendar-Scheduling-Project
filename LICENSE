1. BASIC PERMISSIONS

NEURONET - Rafał Pośpiech (“NEURONET” or “VENDOR”) grants to you ("Licensee") a
non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use current
version of the gantt-schedule-timeline-calendar component (the "Software") only
in non-commercial projects.
This license is valid for one year. After this time, in order to continue using
the software, the license must be renewed.

2. GENERAL RESTRICTIONS

  a. Modifications to the software by the Licensee is not allowed.
  b. Distribution by the Licensee of the software or part(s) of it is
     forbidden.
  c. Software may not be transferred, leased, assigned, or sublicensed, in
     whole or in part.
  d. The software should be registered in the vendor's system using a specially
     prepared tool provided by the vendor, to which the link is located in the
     official project repository or in another place indicated by the vendor.
  e. To use it free of charge for one year, the source code of the application
     using the software (as a whole, including the backend and frontend) must
     be licensed under a MIT or ISC license, publicly available on the Internet
     and registered in the vendor's system as described above. After this time,
     the license may be renewed. If your application is proprietary and / or
     not licensed under the MIT or ISC license with the code publicly available
     on the Internet, you may use this license free of charge in commercial or
     non-commercial application for a period of two months with no renewal
     option. After or during this time, you can purchase a commercial license.

3. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
SOFTWARE.

4. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of
the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply
to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s
negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

5. LITIGATION

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a
jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and
such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

6. MISCELLANEOUS

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe
this License against a Contributor.
NEURONET reserves the right to change or extend the terms of this license by
sending an e-mail to the licensee without the need to modify this document.

7. TERMINATION

The rights granted under this License will automatically terminate if you fail
to comply with any of its terms.
NEURONET reserves the right to terminate or suspend the provisions of this
license, even if the violation of its regulations is not proven in court. For
this, the presumption of infringement is sufficient. The licensee has the right
to send explanations about the situation by email.
